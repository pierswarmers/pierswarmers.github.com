See article here: <a href="http://crossfunctional.net/blog/2013/mar/getting-cozy-dependency-injection">Getting Cozy With Dependency Injection</a>.

You can also catch myself, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rcross">Ryan Cross</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/geoffrey-roberts/4/868/337">Geoffrey Roberts</a> in DrupalCon Portland this May, where we'll be giving a training session on Drupal 8 and Symfony. <a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/node/3723">Registration</a> is now open.
