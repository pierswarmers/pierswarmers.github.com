title: PHP, Symfony, OSX – Oh my!

Sitting down this morning to update my Brew managed PHP install on OSX – I'd planned to document the process. Justin Hileman had already put together this awesome walk through:

[(Re)installing PHP on Mac OS X](http://justinhileman.info/article/reinstalling-php-on-mac-os-x/)

**Note to self:** when the PHP module location changes, Apache fails very silently. Took me a while to figure out what was going on. So don't ignore the "Caveats" notice in the Brew installation output.
